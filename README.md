# TensorFlowJS-ImageRecognition
This web page is a little example of TensorFlowJS using a pre loaded TensorFlow model called MobileNet (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet) which loads an image and identifies the object in it, returning the top 3 predictions with their probability.
